# EDH-GPT
Code for a website that is intended to help you build EDH decks for Magic: The Gathering. 

# Local Setup

## UI
Navigate to the UI directory in your terminal. Run the commands "npm install" followed by "npm run start". If a new tab does not open in your browser to http://localhost:3000/ then navigate there manually. Congrats!

## Backend

Open the EDH-GPT solution file ("~\EDH-GPT\EDH-GPT.API\EDH-GPT.API.sln") in Visual Studio. Clean, build, then run the solution. Currently the api is hosted at https://localhost:7282.
